# Simple Centered Hello World with Theme Toggle

This project presents a minimalistic web page displaying "Hello, World!" centered both horizontally and vertically. It also includes a functional theme toggle button that allows users to switch between light and dark modes, with their preference persisted using local storage.

## Features

*   **Hello, World!**: A clear and prominent "Hello, World!" message.
*   **Centered Content**: The main content is perfectly centered on the page for optimal readability.
*   **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, the page is inherently responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.
*   **Light/Dark Theme Toggle**: A user-friendly button to switch between light and dark color schemes.
*   **Theme Persistence**: User's theme preference is saved in local storage and applied automatically on subsequent visits.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the web page.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
*   **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality, specifically the theme toggle logic and persistence.
