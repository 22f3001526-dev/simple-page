# Hello World & Theme Toggle

This project presents a simple, responsive web page displaying "Hello, World!" with a functional light/dark theme toggle. The selected theme preference is remembered across sessions using `localStorage`.

## Features

*   **"Hello, World!"**: The classic greeting displayed prominently.
*   **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for optimal viewing on various screen sizes.
*   **Light/Dark Theme Toggle**: A button to switch between light and dark modes.
*   **Persistent Theme**: The user's chosen theme is saved in `localStorage` and applied automatically on subsequent visits.
*   **System Preference Integration**: If no theme is saved, the page defaults to the user's system theme preference.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsiveness, included via CDN.
*   **JavaScript**: For theme toggling logic and `localStorage` management.
